1. Explain the importance of Docker in modern software development, provide 2 examples. (20 points)

    Docker allows developers to make their applications much more portable during the development phase.
    It allows developers to make environments for their applications which will create and identical space
    with identical variables on many different machines. It also allows for easier scalability of applications.

2. Explain how Docker containers are different from virtual machines, provide 2 examples. (20 points)

    Virtual machines are meant to make applications available across different hardware while docker allows
    applications to be run on different operating systems. For example, a VM will allow for a mac computer
    to run a copy of Windows and use Windows applications. This is better in situations where an entire machine
    needs to be emulated. Docker, however, uses containers which allow for containers, which contains everything
    an application needs to run anywhere, which makes it much more portable. For example, a docker container will
    contain all the commands necessary for installing packages that will allow the application to run.
